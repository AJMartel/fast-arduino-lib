FastArduino 1.1 release

I am happy to announce the 2nd major release of FastArduino platform.

Since release 1.0 (February 2018), the following main changes have been implemented:

- Build is now using C++14, with AVR-GCC 7.2.0 (tested on fedora 28 distribution)
- Updated Watchdog API to add WatchdogRTT class
- Reworked sonar API to support timeout, higher performance and higher precision
- Redesigned ISR registration (no change in API though), reduce macros usage
- Updated coding guidelines to fit clang-format 6 (latest available package on fedora 28)
- Implemented MCP23017 chip support
- Completed core API documentation
- Completed tutorial for core API

All features have been tested on all supported targets.

Known bugs and enhancements: https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib/issues

The platform is well documented:

- a tutorial allows developers to discover and learn the platform step by step
- FastArduino core API is documented through doxygen and documentation is publihed here
- FastArduino comes with many examples covering all supported features and devices

I hope you'll enjoy playing with FastArduino platform and submit enhancements you would like 
to see in future versions or report issues you may discover.
