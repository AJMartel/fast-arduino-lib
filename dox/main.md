FastArduino Documentation	{#index}
=========================

Welcome to FastArduino documentation!

FastArduino is a C++ object-oriented library for Arduino boards based on AVR MCU and also bare AVR MCU. FastArduino:

- provides smaller and faster code than other libraries for the same functionality
- ensures you pay (size and speed) only for what you use
- uses Object-Oriented Design
- reduces risk of bad code by performing extensive compile-time checks
- supports event-driven programs
- supports both ATmega and ATtiny chips

FastArduino implementation:
- is based on C++11 standard
- favours C++ templates rather than virtual methods whenever possible
- virtual methods are used only when needed (mostly for event handlers)
- never automatically registers any ISR but requires explicit registration through provided macros

The rest of this guide provides indications where to start and proceed with learning how to use FastArduino for your projects.
