Licences used by FastArduino
----------------------------

For almost all files, source code is licensed under [Apache Software License 2.0](LICENSE-2.0.txt).

However, NRF24L01P device support files are licensed under [GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1](LICENSE.txt) as derivative work from Cosa library, adapted to fit FastArduino framework.

As a result, any project using FastArduino but not any NRF24L01P stuff, must comply to ASL 2.0: but a project using FastArduino and its NRF24L01P support classes hast to comply to the more restricted LGPL 2.1.

This is also valid for examples accompanying the FastArduino project.
